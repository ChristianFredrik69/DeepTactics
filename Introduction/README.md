# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to the Introduction folder! This section serves as your starting point in the world of reinforcement learning. 

## What's Inside?

1. **Code Implementations**: You'll find code examples that implement various reinforcement-learning algorithms. These algorithms are directly based on the methods presented in [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ). 

2. **Easy21 Assignment**: One of the folders contains solutions to the [Easy21 Assignment](https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Easy21-Johannes.pdf), a task designed to give you hands-on experience with reinforcement learning algorithms.

## How to Use This Section

- If you're new to reinforcement learning, we recommend starting with David Silver's course for a theoretical foundation.
- Then, you can delve into the code examples to see the algorithms in action.
- For a more challenging task, take a look at the Easy21 assignment and our proposed solutions.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts is helpful but not required
