# 🚀 Advanced Reinforcement Learning: DQN in CartPole 🎮

## 🔍 About DQN

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is an off-policy algorithm for approximating the optimal action-value function. It combines Q-Learning with Deep Learning techniques to handle high-dimensional inputs better.

## 🛠 Implementation Details

Our implementation features:

- **Q-Network**: A neural network that approximates the Q-value function.
- **Target Network**: A network that periodically updates to match the Q-network, stabilizing training.
- **Replay Buffer**: A memory system that stores previous experiences for more robust learning.
